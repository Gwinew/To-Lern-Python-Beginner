1. Check all preconditions
2. Prepere for consequences


LBYL - Look before you leap
EAFP - Easier to ask forgivness than permission

Python prefers EAFP
The code's 'happy path' is emphasized rather than being interspersed with error handling

Example: file processing

processing detail are not important
process_file() open a file and reads it


EAFP is enabled by exceptions

Without exceptions, error handling is interspersed in program flow

Exceptions can be handled non-locally

EAFP plus Exceptions:
1. Exceptions are not easily ignored
2. Error codes are silent by default
3. Exceptions plus EAFP makes it hard for problems to be silently ignored
