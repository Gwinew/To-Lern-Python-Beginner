Loop

in cmd write "python" to start python


_ - is special sign take value to memory and we can using on another calculation

quit() - to the end of python in cmd

In CMD we can operating on formulas like in IDLE but is little annoying.
When we get to go to another line after using a operation then we need remember to start add 4 spaces or TAB.
>>> for i in range(5):
...     x = i * 10
...	print(x)
...	<press ENTER>


Significant Whitespace Rules:

1. Prefer four spaces
2. Never mix spaces and tabs
3. Be consistent on consecutive lines
4. Only deviate to improve readability

Proframing as Guido intended it  or  indented


Import:

import module_name
e.g.
import math


When we want to use atrtribute from the module, then we use:
module_name.atrribute_name
e.g.
math.sqrt(25)

help(module_name) - return the attribute with description: "space" to go to next page "q" to exit
e.g.
help(math)
help(math.factorial)


Import with attribute:
e.g.

from math import factorial
n=5
k=3
factorial(n) / (factorial(k) *factorial(n-k))


We can use alias:
from math import factorial as fac
fac(n) /(fac(k) * fac(n-k))
