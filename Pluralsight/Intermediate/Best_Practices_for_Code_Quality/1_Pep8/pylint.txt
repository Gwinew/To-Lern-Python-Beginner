Inside virtual enviroment install pylint:

python install pylint

When we want to check a codefile:

pylint <name_folder>/<name_file.py> 	# If we want check a entire folders then don't write "/<name_file.py>"


Output text of code wich is waring:
pylint --generate-rcfile

We can save this text:

pylint --generate-rcfile >pylintrc

in this pylintrc we can change a values in good names, like: tata
and we don't get warrings information about this value anymore
