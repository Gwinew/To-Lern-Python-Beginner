We want to check as version of pip and location. In cmd we write:
pip -V

If You don't have a information about PIP, than You must install PIP for your Python.

pip comes pre - installed with Python from python website and remember, the important thing is add python path to your computer.

### Install on Windows:

During install python on windows we must check 'Add Python to enviroment variables'.

If you forget that then we must find a path to Python, copy this path (propably in user-folder in AppData\locals\programs\Python),

The next step is go to computer propertise and go to advanced system propertis.
Go to Enviroment Variables...
Use 'New' or when you have 'Path' then click 'edit', and click 'New' Inside and paste the path. Also you add path with \scripts.


### Install on Linux:

Use package manager...

sudo apt install python-pip

We can checked python 3 version on the computer:

python3 -V

when we want install python 3 (because propably we have python 2 on the computer):

yum install python3

When we want install pip from python 3:

sudo apt install python3-pip
