Managing packages with pip:
- Installing packages
- Removing packages
- listing packages
- Inspecting packages
- Getting help

Best Practice:

Always work inside a virtual enviroment
Don't use pip with sudo

List of packages and version of packages:

pip list

install packages e.g. requests:

pip install requests - don't do that - this install a packages depend to work whis package

uninstall packages e.g. requests:

pip unistall requests - don't unistal another package with this

pip unistall urllib3 chardet idna certifi - multiunistall package command




pip help - show a command to use

pip help list - show command to use in list section command

e.g.

pip list -o


Get info on a specific package:

pip show requests


##########################

import sys
sys.path

We get list of directories.

It is possible we have packaage to the another version of python.
Then we want to use install package to python 3.

pip3 install requests


#######################

default version of install package is for python 2

the better way is:

python3.7 -m pip install flask

pip install --upgrade pip - don't use that
