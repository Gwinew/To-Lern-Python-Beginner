1. Instal from setup.py all packages
command line: python setup.py install

2. Run the pytest
command line: python -m pytest

3. Add argument "not slow" and we testing without large objected marked .slow
command line: python -m pytest -m "not slow"

In PyCharm during create a pytest configuration - in the additional arguments we write:
-m "not slow"

marking:
in pytest.ini is markers = slow:
and this name go to test_large_books to @pytest.mark.slow
and when we want to use pytest without this test then we use "not slow"

'slow' is 'name'

4. If we want to skip any test then befor test we add @pytest.mark.skip('WIP')

5. If we want to skip if python version is too old:
@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3,6), reaseon="requires python3.6 or higher')
