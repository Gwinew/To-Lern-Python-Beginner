Mock and Spies Do more Than Stubs:

- Stub:
Will not fail the test

- Mock or Spy:
Can fail the test if it's not called correctly

Three Kinds of assert

- Return Value
or an exception

- State change
Use an API to query the new state

- Method call:
Did a specific method get called on a collaborator

Assert on the method return value:

def test_convert_quotes():
    fake_file = io.StringIO("quote: ' ")
    converter = HtmlPagesConverter(open_file=fake_file)
    converted_text = converter.get_html_page(0)
    assert converted_text == "quote: &#x27;<br />"

Assert on the alarm state:

def test_alarm_is_off_by_default():
    alarm = Alarm()
    assert not alarm.is_alarm_on
