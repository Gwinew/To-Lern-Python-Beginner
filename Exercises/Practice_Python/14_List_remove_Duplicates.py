"""
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and return a new list
that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

    Extras:
        - Write two different function to do this:
            one using a loop and constructing a list,
            and another using sets.
        - Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution
            for that in a different function.
